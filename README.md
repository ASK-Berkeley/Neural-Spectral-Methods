<h1> Neural Spectral Methods </h1>

This repo contains the JAX implementation of our paper *Neural Spectral Methods: Self-supervised learning in the spectral domain*. Neural Spectral Methods (NSM) is a class of machine learning approach designed for solving parametric PDEs within the spectral domain. Above is a demonstration of NSM's prediction the 2D Navier-Stokes equation.

> We present Neural Spectral Methods, a technique to solve parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), grounded in classical spectral methods. Our method uses orthogonal bases to learn PDE solutions as mappings between spectral coefficients. In contrast to current machine learning approaches which enforce PDE constraints by minimizing the numerical quadrature of the residuals in the spatiotemporal domain, we leverage Parseval’s identity and introduce a new training strategy through a spectral loss. Our spectral loss enables more efficient differentiation through the neural network, and substantially reduces training complexity. At inference time, the computational cost of our method remains constant, regardless of the spatiotemporal resolution of the domain. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous machine learning approaches in terms of speed and accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude on multiple different problems. When compared to numerical solvers of the same accuracy, our method demonstrates a 10× increase in performance speed.

Source code will be made available soon.
