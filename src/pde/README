This module defines the interface of PDE classess. Abstract classes in `_domain`
and `_params` modules defines domain and PDE parameter. Functions in `mollifier`
define how each type of boundary condition can be satisfied by transforming the
predicted solution. Built on these classes, the general `PDE` class defines how
the residual terms are computed in both the physical and spectral domain, which
will be used by the models for loss calculation.

Each subdirectory contains a instantiation of these interface, together with a
`generate` module for numerical solution generation. Follow these templates if
you want to try a new problem.
